# Fashion-MNIST
In this project, I experiment with the Fashion Mnist dataset by visualising the dataset and training a basic ANN model which achieved a accuracy rate of 88%. 
Also, I trained a CNN model with 3 Convolution layers and 2 Dense layers which could classify the fashion apparels with an accuracy of ~91%. And The training details have been visualised using TensorBoard.
